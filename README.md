# GitHub Issues Per Milestone

There are two things in this repo:

* A Node.js script that fetches open and closed issues from a GitHub repo filtered on a particular label.
  It writes these issues to a file called 'issues.js'.

* An tiny HTML5 application written with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) that groups the issues per
  milestone and displays them in a [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) GUI.

To test it locally (i.e., without a web server), you can use Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files argument.

That's it! Nothing complicated, nothing fancy.
